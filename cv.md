**Information about me:**
My first university education was related to psychology, but over time I developed a love for programming. After reading many books on the topic of promization, I realized that it was exactly what I like. I believe and will try to become a good developer. I am interested in web development, because this occupation provides endless opportunities for professional growth,
in addition, there is a huge number of free, high-quality self-education resources and a large developer community.
